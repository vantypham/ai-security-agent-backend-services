# INTRODUCTION
My plan is to build a system called AI-Powered Security Agent. It will scan for security issues, vulnerabilities, and CVEs in our code while developers are working in the VS Code IDE, as well as during GitHub pull requests, Jenkins CI builds, and CLI scans.

In the design, I will have a core AI backend that exposes APIs written in Python using FastAPI. This backend will call LLMs (such as OpenAI models) to analyze code, detect issues, suggest remediations, and enforce security policies. The core backend will support VS Code actions, GitHub Actions for PR triggers, CLI tools, and Jenkins build scripts.

I also plan to develop a VS Code extension that triggers local tools such as Semgrep and Gitleaks to identify OWASP Top 10 issues and other customizable company security rules and policies

## ARCHITECTURE
### Core AI backend (Python/FastAPI + LLM orchestration)
Acts as the central services for analysis and coordination.

### Multiple clients:
- VS Code extension
- GitHub Actions
- Jenkins pipeline
- CLI tool

### Local/static scanners:
- Semgrep
- Gitleaks

### AI layer:
- Explains findings
- Provides remediation suggestions
- Performs enforcement and policy checks

### Needs
- Python 3.12.x/pip
- uv
- semgrep
- gitleaks
- fastapi
- uvicorn
- openai
- dotenv

## Commands
python -c "import fastapi; print(fastapi.__version__)"
uv pip install fastapi uvicorn openai python-dotenv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate  
uv venv 
vsce --version
vsce package
semgrep --version  
semgrep --config auto --json ./src > semgrep-scan2.json 
pip install semgrep 

## Execution
- uv sync
- uvicorn app.main:app
